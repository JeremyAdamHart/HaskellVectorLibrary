# HaskellVectorLibrary
This is intended to be a very minimal matrix/vector library little consideration has been put into efficiency

The operators:
  *.
  .*
  .*.
  .+.
  .-.
Have been added for operations between matrices and scalars.

General usage is that there is always a '.' on a side of the operator that accepts a matrix
